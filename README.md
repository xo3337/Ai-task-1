# Ai-task-1
I used a pretrained model trained using Teachable Machine. The model was trained on a dog and cat image dataset from Kaggle. The estimated training time was about 1 hour and 30 minutes. It gives amazing accuracy in identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. However, it cannot detect both animals in the same imageâ€”it only outputs the class with the highest probability, so it always predicts either "dog" or "cat," not both. I will provide the model, the dataset, the code, and some test images containing dogs, cats, and both.
