# Ai-task-1
I used a pretrained model trained using Teachable Machine. The model was trained on a dog and cat image dataset from Kaggle. The estimated training time was about 1 hour and 30 minutes. It gives amazing accuracy in identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. However, it cannot detect both animals in the same image it only outputs the class with the highest probability, so it always predicts either "dog" or "cat," not both, the code from Teachable Machine, I will provide the model, the dataset, the code, and some test images containing dogs, cats, and both.


the dataset too big so i will provide the link :
